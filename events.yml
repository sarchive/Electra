# This file follows the YAML specification and is parsed by the YAML parser, constructed in memory, then compiled into Java bytecode via the Electra Event Compiler.
# The Electra Event Compiler compiles all the events into a JAR named "events.jar" to be included in your classpath. Make sure you configure your IDE to include "events.jar" if you use an IDE.
# One of the main features is the ability to determine the length of the packet automatically. If there's an expression for the amount of elements in an array or a string then we know that it's variable in its length.
# Another feature is that you can define custom data types. These types will also be explicitly available to you in your code. These are just compiled as subclasses.
# Arrays can either have a fixed size or a dynamic size. Dynamically sized arrays use expressions. Any numeric variable that has previously been parsed can be used in the expression.
# There are a few variables which aren't immediately apparent. These variables are size, remaining, and current.
# Size is the total size of the event, remaining (size - current) is how much you have left to read, and current is how much you have read already.
# Expressions support all basic math functions and you can use constant numbers. Any data type can be read as an array and any array can be read *expression* amount of times.
